Appendix iv Helping your test takers prepare
The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) assesses the English language proficiency of people who want to study or work in English-speaking environments. It provides a fair, accurate and relevant assessment of language skills, based on well-established standards, and covers the full range of proficiency levels, from non-user to expert user.

There are two main tests. Test takers can choose either Academic or General Training tests. Both tests consist of four separate sections, assessing the four language skills - Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking.

IELTS results are reported on a 9-band scale designed to be simple and easy to understand. This scale has remained consistent and has acquired currency around the world over the past three decades.
� IELTS is the world's most popular high stakes English language test, with over 3.5 million tests taken last year
� Over 10,000 organisations in over 140 countries recognise and use IELTS for selection purposes
� IELTS is offered at over 1,600 test locations worldwide
� Test questions are developed by testing specialists
in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the US
� Test questions are based on authentic materials sourced from all over the world

An overview of the test
Test takers can choose between IELTS Academic and IELTS General Training, depending on their academic or professional aspirations, or visa requirements.
The difference between the two tests is that the Reading and Writing sections of IELTS Academic have subject matter and tasks suitable for the test takers entering undergraduate or postgraduate studies. The Listening and Speaking sections are the same.
Listening 30 minutes
Test takers listen to four recorded texts, monologues and conversations by a range of native speakers, and write their answers to a series of questions.
Reading 60 minutes
The Academic test includes three long texts which range from the descriptive and factual to the discursive
and analytical. The texts are authentic and are taken from books, journals, magazines and newspapers and are on academic topics of general interest. All have been selected for a non-specialist audience.

The General Training test requires test takers to read extracts from newspapers, advertisements, instruction manuals and books. These are materials test takers could encounter on a daily basis in an English speaking country.
Writing 60 minutes
The Academic test includes two tasks. Topics are selected to be of general interest and suitable for test takers entering undergraduate or postgraduate studies or seeking professional registration.

Task 1
Test takers are presented with a graph, table, chart or diagram and are asked to describe, summarise or
explain the information in their own words. They may be asked to describe and explain data, describe the stages of a process, how something works or describe an object or event.

Task 2
Test takers are asked to write an essay in response to a point of view, argument or problem.

Responses to both tasks must be written in an academic or semi-formal neutral style.

The General Training test also includes two tasks, and is based on topics of general interest.

Task 1
Test takers are presented with a situation and are asked to write a letter requesting information or explaining the situation. The letter may be personal, semi-formal or formal in style.

Task 2
Test takers are asked to write an essay in response to a point of view, argument or problem. The essay can be slightly more personal in style than the Academic Writing Task 2 essay.
Speaking 11-14 minutes
The Speaking test is carried out face-to-face with a trained IELTS examiner, as we believe this is the most effective way of assessing a test taker's speaking skills. This section takes between 11 and 14 minutes
to complete. Every test is digitally recorded and consists of three parts:

Part 1
Test takers answer general questions about themselves and a range of familiar topics, such as their home, family, work, studies and interests. This part lasts between four and five minutes.

Part 2
Test takers are given a booklet which asks them to talk about a particular topic. They have one minute to prepare before speaking for up to two minutes. The examiner may ask
one or two questions on the same topic to finish this part of the test.

Part 3
Test takers are asked further questions which are connected to the topic in Part 2. These questions give the test taker an opportunity to discuss more abstract issues and ideas. This part lasts between four and five minutes.

The format of the Speaking test is common across both the Academic and General Training tests. It is structured in such a way that does not allow test takers to rehearse set responses beforehand.

IELTS Academic measures English language proficiency needed for an academic, higher education environment. The tasks and texts are accessible to
all test takers, irrespective of their subject focus.

IELTS General Training measures English language proficiency in a practical, everyday context. The tasks and texts reflect both workplace and social situations.



Listening* (30 minutes)
� Four recorded monologues and conversations



Reading (60 minutes)
� Three long reading passages with tasks
� Texts range from the descriptive and factual to the discursive and analytical
� Includes non-verbal materials such as diagrams, graphs or illustrations
� Texts are authentic (e.g. taken from books, journals and newspapers)


Writing (60 minutes)
� Writing task of at least 150 words where the test taker must summarise, describe or explain a table, graph, chart or diagram
� Short essay task of at least 250 words

Reading (60 minutes)
� Three reading passages with tasks
� Section 1 contains two or three short factual texts
� Section 2 contains two short, work-related, factual texts
 � Section 3 contains one longer text on a topic of general interest
  � Texts are authentic (e.g. taken from company handbooks, official documents,
books and newspapers)


Writing (60 minutes)
� Letter writing task of at least 150 words
� Short essay task of at least 250 words



Speaking (11 to 14 minutes)
� Face-to-face interview
� Includes short questions, speaking at length about a familiar topic and a structured discussion





Key similarities
� The Listening and Speaking sections are the same for both tests. The distinction between 'academic' and 'general' literacy has traditionally been seen as most marked in relation to Reading and Writing skills. The more socially-oriented language skills of Listening and Speaking are equally important in an academic study or professional context
� The same amount of time is allocated to complete the Listening and Speaking sections in both the General Training and Academic tests
� The Reading and Writing sections are the same length in both tests
� Both tests have the same minimum word requirement
� The same assessment criteria and 9-band scale is used to grade both tests

A detailed breakdown of the test format can be found in the Guide for educational institutions, governments, professional bodies and commercial organisations and the Information for Candidates booklets, both available at ielts.org

Differences
The Reading section of the Academic and General Training tests is differentiated in terms of:
� The choice of texts (topic, genre, length, number, etc)
� The level of difficulty of the 40 test items. The Academic Reading section has more items pitched at bands 5-8, whereas the General Training has more items pitched
at bands 3-6. This is a reflection of the different demands of Academic and General Training

For Writing, the Academic and General Training tests are differentiated in terms of:
� The content and nature of the two writing tasks
� The contextual parameters of the tasks

However, given the level of differentiation described above, this does not mean that the scores across Academic and General Training Reading or Writing sections are interchangeable.



























To give test takers more choice, IELTS is now offered in both paper-based and computer-delivered formats.
Paper-based IELTS
This test requires test takers to sit at a desk with the question papers and answer sheets for the Listening, Reading and Writing tests in an official IELTS test centre. Test takers will write their answers in either pen or HB-pencil.
Computer-delivered IELTS
This test requires test takers to sit the Listening, Reading and Writing tests in front of a computer with the questions presented on the screen in an official IELTS test centre. The test takers then submit their answers through the use of a keyboard and a mouse. The Speaking test is
not on computer and is carried out face-to-face with a trained IELTS examiner.

Still the same trusted IELTS test
Whether test takers take IELTS on paper or computer, they can be confident that they are taking the same trusted English language test, with no differences in:

� Content	� Question types
� Test timings	� Security
� Structure	� Speaking test
� Marking	� Test Report Form









Should test takers take IELTS on paper or computer? This comes down to personal choice. They may be used to taking exams on paper from other exam situations they have experienced, whereas other people might feel more comfortable typing or have more experience taking tests on computer. Information on both options is available on ielts.org and they can contact their test centre if they would like further information.

Will there be any change to the IELTS Results Verification Service?
No. The IELTS Results Verification Service will continue to operate as usual. As the global roll out of computer- delivered IELTS progresses, enhancements to the current service will continue to be evaluated.

What practice materials are available for test takers? Sample test question and familiarisation materials are available ielts.org/oncomputer

Is IELTS on a computer harder than IELTS on paper?
No. The test will be the same as paper-based IELTS in terms of content, scoring, level of difficulty and question types.

A test of four skills








IELTS is a task-based test covering the four language skills (Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking). IELTS test takers receive individual scores for each of the four test sections.
The average of the four provides the overall band score.

Each of the four sections is carefully designed to focus on one particular skill. This makes it easier to control task difficulty across the many different tests produced each year and results in a fairer test design when compared with tests that assess multiple skills simultaneously.

Organisations that rely on IELTS as proof of English language proficiency benefit from knowing that the score given for each section of the test is a clear and fair reflection of the test taker's ability in that skill.

This is particularly important in academic and professional settings where one skill is deemed to be more important than others.

For example, in Canada nurses are required to achieve a higher band score in their IELTS Speaking and Writing tests, while teachers in Australia are required to achieve higher scores in their IELTS Speaking and Listening tests.

While IELTS focuses on testing the four skills individually, there is inevitably an element of integration in each section, in the same way that language skills are integrated in the real world. Test tasks often entail the use of other skills and are therefore 'integrated' to some degree, for example:

� In the Writing and Speaking sections, information that is read or heard helps shape the test taker's own production. However, this is carefully controlled to ensure that the test taker is not required to carry out extensive or complex reading and listening in order to respond to the task. This is particularly important because a score for each skill is being reported and it would be unfair to test takers if their performance in one skill area was compromised by their lack of proficiency in another

� Tasks in the Reading and Listening sections can involve note-taking, labelling and completion of tables or flow charts. Nonetheless, it is important that any task or test items should focus on reading or listening and should not require detailed writing

The IELTS
9-band scale





















There is no pass or fail in IELTS. Each band corresponds to a level of competence in English. All parts of the test and the overall band score are reported in whole or half bands,
e.g. 7.0, 8.5.

Test takers receive an overall band score as well as individual scores for each test section (Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking).



How to interpret IELTS
Test takers receive scores on a band scale from 1 to 9.
A profile score is reported for each skill. The four individual scores are averaged and rounded to produce an overall band score. Overall band scores and scores for each section (Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking) are reported
in whole bands or half bands.

Overall band score
Test takers receive a Test Report Form including or listing their overall band score and their sub-scores on each of the four sections: Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking. Each of the section scores is equally weighted. The overall band score is calculated by taking the mean of the total of the four individual section scores.

Overall band scores are reported to the nearest whole
or half band. The following rounding convention applies;
if the average across the four skills ends in .25, it is rounded up to the next half band, and if it ends in .75, it is rounded
up to the next whole band.

Thus, a test taker achieving 6.5 for Listening, 6.5 for Reading, 5.0 for Writing and 7.0 for Speaking would be awarded an overall band score of 6.5 (25 � 4 = 6.25 = Band
6.5 Likewise, a test taker achieving 4.0 for Listening, 3.5 for Reading, 4.0 for Writing and 4.0 for Speaking would be awarded an overall band score of 4.0 (15.5 � 4 = 3.875 =
Band 4.0).

On the other hand, a test taker achieving 6.5 for Listening,
6.5 for Reading, 5.5 for Writing and 6.0 for Speaking would be awarded band 6 (24.5 � 4 = 6.125 = Band 6).

Understanding IELTS scores
IELTS scores are reported on the nine-band scale. The Academic and General Training tests are marked using the same criteria.

� The tasks and grading used for the Listening and Speaking sections are the same for IELTS Academic and IELTS General Training. The more socially oriented language skills of Listening and Speaking are equally important
in an academic study or workplace context

� The tasks, test content and grading of the Reading and Writing sections differ between IELTS Academic and IELTS General Training. This is because the distinction between 'academic' and 'general' literacy has usually been seen as most marked in reading and writing skills

IELTS scores and interpretation













Setting IELTS band score requirements for recognising organisations
IELTS test scores are just one element of the assessment of a test taker's suitability to enrol at an institution or to join an organisation. The level of English needed for a test taker to perform effectively in study, work or training varies from one situation to another. That is why each individual organisation sets its own minimum IELTS score for applicants, depending on specific requirements. Admissions professionals may also wish to take into account whether their organisation provides ongoing language support to students or employees to improve their English.

The IELTS Scores Guide provides detailed descriptions of the test sections and sample test materials. This resource contains real examples of test takers' writing and speaking performances at different band score levels. A copy can be requested from your local stakeholder relations teams.

International partners
IELTS is owned by a global partnership of education and language experts: the British Council, IDP: IELTS Australia and Cambridge Assessment English. These bodies are dedicated to academic excellence, cultural understanding, student recruitment, and creating success worldwide.
The IELTS test combines the world-renowned assessment and research expertise of Cambridge Assessment English and the international delivery, evaluation and security expertise of the British Council and IDP: IELTS Australia.

International consultation
IELTS has been developed in close consultation with academics, professional bodies and immigration authorities around the world.

International content
The IELTS approach is recognised by academics and admissions professionals as being fair, reliable and valid to all test takers, whatever their nationality, cultural background, gender or specific needs. The test questions are developed by item writers in Australia, Canada,
New Zealand, the UK and the US.

International delivery and accessibility
IELTS tests are offered up to four times a month at over 1,600 test locations in more than 140 countries.
The cost of taking the test is set locally and payable in the local currency, making registration more convenient for test takers. Results are issued to test takers 13 days after paper-based tests and after 5-7 days for computer- delivered. IELTS test centres can send Test Report Forms directly to an organisation or institution (provided they have opted in and been nominated by the test taker), either by mail or as an electronic download.

IELTS USA
IELTS supports organisations in the United States that use IELTS to measure the English language proficiency of international applicants. IELTS USA also manages the administration of IELTS test operations across the United States.

International English
IELTS recognises both British and American English spelling, grammar and choice of words. It also incorporates a mix of native speaker accents from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and US in the Listening section.

The number of people migrating and studying abroad has multiplied over the last 30 years. This has transformed life in educational institutions.

In English-speaking countries, more and more universities recruit staff internationally, and this is matched by an increasing student intake of non-native speakers of English. Simultaneously, in non-English speaking countries, more organisations are using English as a common language
of communication, as well as employing rising numbers of staff from English-speaking countries. Consequently, more people are teaching, studying and working with others who speak different varieties of English.









The way IELTS results are reported makes it easy for teachers see which areas of a learner's language skills need to be developed, and helps them set learners clear goals and objectives. Teaching techniques for IELTS include presenting language elements such as grammar and vocabulary in a wider context.

The topics in IELTS are both interesting and contemporary, and are based on real world contexts. This means teachers can bring the outside world into their IELTS classes by using a range of authentic source materials adapted
to test preparation.


Tips from teachers








Listening
Make sure your students:
� Think about the context before they listen and identify the type of information they will need to listen for
� Read the questions before they hear the text and use the time between each section to prepare for the following section
Reading
Make sure your students:
� Use reading skills such as skimming and scanning - they will need to use these skills to answer all the questions in 1 hour
� Know how best to approach each type of reading task
� Answer the questions and transfer their answers to the answer sheet within the time allowed

Writing
Make sure your students:
� Analyse the question carefully and plan their answer before starting to write
� Keep in mind the reader and the purpose when writing
� Structure their writing logically and clearly
� Decide on a position and use examples and evidence to support points they make in task 2
Speaking
Make sure your students:
� Feel confident and remind them to relax and enjoy the conversation with the examiner
� Listen carefully to the questions
� Use fillers and hesitation devices if they need 'thinking time' before answering
� Realise it is their language level not their opinions which are being evaluated
General
Make sure your students:
� Are familiar with the format and types of tasks in the different sections of the IELTS test
� Know what is expected of them and how best to approach each section
� Are aware of the time allowed for each section and include timed practice in class
� Read the instructions carefully and follow them
� Are familiar with the assessment criteria




Becoming an IELTS examiner






The worldwide recognition of IELTS and the increasing numbers of IELTS test takers has in some countries led to growth in demand for IELTS examiners.

For teachers familiar with IELTS, becoming an IELTS examiner offers a possible opportunity for professional development.
Becoming an IELTS Speaking examiner
IELTS Speaking examiners worldwide are supported by the IELTS Professional Support Network, a system of recruitment, training, standardisation and monitoring. The Professional Support Network is jointly managed by the British Council and IDP: IELTS Australia.

All IELTS examiner applicants must:
� Have a degree qualification (or equivalent)
� Hold relevant qualifications in Teaching English as a Foreign Language (or equivalent)
� Have substantial relevant teaching experience
� Demonstrate English language ability equivalent to an IELTS Band 9
Next steps
If you are interested in becoming an IELTS Speaking examiner and you meet the requirements outlined above, please contact your local test centre.

If you are interested in becoming an IELTS Writing examiner and you meet the requirements outlined above, please refer to the British Council or IDP: IELTS Australia career websites.



The examiner system

Recruitment
In addition to the required qualifications and experience, the professional and interpersonal skills of examiner applicants are assessed at three stages in the recruitment process: application form, interview, and training.

Induction
Shortlisted applicants are interviewed and, if successful, complete an induction process.


Training
Applicants who successfully complete induction proceed to training, which is carried out by an examiner trainer and lasts 1.5 days for each section.

Certification
Applicants then complete a certification set to demonstrate that they can apply the assessment criteria accurately and reliably; if they pass, they are certified as IELTS examiners.





IELTS Speaking examiners Year 1: Monitoring
Examiners are monitored at least once every two years. New examiners (and those who have not recently worked as IELTS examiners) are monitored three times in their first year. Monitoring is carried out by examiner trainers. All examiners receive written feedback on their ratings and also on the delivery of the Speaking test. They may be required to take corrective action if any issues are raised about their performance.

IELTS Writing examiners
Writing Examiners are monitored on a regular basis by IDP: IELTS Australia or British Council Examiner Standards Managers. Writing examiners also standardise and recertify every two years.


Year 2: Standardisation and recertification
Standardisation sessions are held every two years and are led by an examiner trainer. Standardisation is completed at the centre and takes place as close as possible to the biennial recertification of the examiner. After the standardisation session, the examiners then complete a different certification set to demonstrate they continue to apply the assessment criteria accurately.




.










The success of IELTS rests on attention to four key test qualities - validity, reliability, impact and practicality.
These four factors have been the subject of a great deal of research involving academics, administrators, teachers and other practitioners throughout the world for more than 40 years.

The IELTS partners lead an extensive programme of international research designed to ensure the quality and continual improvement of IELTS tests.

Advances in applied linguistics, language pedagogy, language assessment and technological capabilities constantly challenge test developers to review, refine
and reshape their approaches to test design, development, delivery and evaluation. The steady evolution of IELTS clearly demonstrates how such factors shape the development of a large-scale, high-stakes language test.

The IELTS research programme ensures:
� The ongoing usefulness and contemporary relevance of the test for organisations that use IELTS results
� That IELTS contributes more broadly to the growing understanding of the nature of language proficiency and its place within linguistics and language education

Internal research
Internal research activities are managed by Cambridge Assessment English and are co-ordinated within a framework for ongoing test development and validation.

Cambridge Assessment English makes a valuable contribution to the wider field of language assessment through a number of presentations and publications, in particular, Studies in Language Testing (SiLT). SiLT
is a series of academic volumes that addresses a diverse range of important issues and new developments in language testing and assessment that are of interest
to test users, developers and researchers. For more information, go to cambridgeenglish.org/silt

Research relating to IELTS test development and validation activities is also published in Research Notes (RN). For more information, go to cambridgeenglish.org/research-notes

External research
The IELTS research programme, jointly funded by the British Council and IDP: IELTS Australia, ensures an ongoing relationship with the broader linguistics and language testing community and demonstrates the IELTS partners' commitment to continuous improvement of the test.

Since 1995, more than 130 external studies by over 280 researchers in 16 countries have attracted funding under this scheme. Selected reports are available online in IELTS Research Reports ielts.org/research

How IELTS maps to the Common European Framework of Reference for Language (CEFR)







How should the CEFR be used by recognising institutions wishing to set language ability requirements?

In fulfilling its purpose as a common reference tool, the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages was not designed to provide the basis for precise equating, nor was it intended to be a prescriptive tool to impose standardised solutions. Rather it was designed as a common framework of reference, primarily intended as
'a tool for reflection, communications and empowerment', as described by John Trim, its coordinating author, (Saville, N (2005)). The IELTS partners recommend that all test result users should look at the IELTS bandscore descriptors and use the IELTS Scores Guide to establish the appropriate level of language ability required for their particular institution or course.






26

However, test users may also find the Council of Europe's Common European Framework of Reference for Languages helpful. The Framework, a series of descriptions of abilities at different learning levels, which can be applied to any language, can provide a starting point for interpreting
and comparing different language qualifications, and is increasingly used as a way of benchmarking language ability not only within Europe but worldwide.

To help test users understand the relationship between IELTS band scores and the six CEFR levels, Cambridge Assessment English has conducted a number of studies to map the IELTS scale to the CEFR, drawing on the interrelationship between IELTS and Cambridge Assessment English Qualifications and the known relationship of these latter qualifications to the CEFR.

Figure 1: The mapping of the IELTS scale to the Common European Framework above is derived from the interrelationship between IELTS and Cambridge Assessment English Qualifications and the mapping
of these latter qualifications to the CEFR. Further information on this can be found at cambridgeenglish.org/cefr

General information
Making comparisons between scores on different tests is challenging because many of the current range of test
products differ in their design, purpose, and format (Taylor, 2004a). Test takers' aptitude and preparation for a particular type of test may also vary and individual test takers or groups of test takers may perform better in certain tests than in others.

Specifying the relationship between a test product and the CEFR is challenging because, in order to function
as a framework, the CEFR is deliberately underspecified (Davidson & Fulcher, 2007; Milanovic, 2009; Weir, 2005). Establishing the relationship is also not a one-off activity, but rather involves the accumulation of evidence over time (e.g. it needs to be shown that test quality and standards are maintained).

The relationship of IELTS with the CEFR is complex as IELTS is not a level-based test, but rather designed to span a much broader proficiency continuum. It also utilises a different 9-point band scoring system; thus, there will
not be a one-to-one correspondence between IELTS scores and CEFR levels. It is important to bear in mind the
differences in test purpose, test format, test populations, and measurement scales when seeking to make comparisons.

IELTS Guide for teachers














With the above in mind, Cambridge Assessment English has conducted a number of research projects since the late 1990s to explore how IELTS band scores align with the CEFR levels. A number of these were summarised in Taylor (2004b), while cautioning that, "As we grow in our understanding of the relationship between IELTS and the CEFR levels, so the frame of reference may need to be revised accordingly."

Note that the IELTS band scores referred to in Figure 1 above are the overall band scores, not the individual module band scores for Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking.
It is important to recognise that the purpose of this figure is to communicate the relationship between IELTS
performances and the CEFR. They should not be interpreted as reflecting strong claims about exact equivalence between assessment products or the scores they generate, for the reasons given in Taylor (2004a).

The current alignment is based upon a growing body
of internal and external research, some of which has also appeared in peer-reviewed academic journals, attesting
to their quality (e.g. Hawkey & Barker, 2004). This research has been further combined with long established experience of test use within education and society, as well as feedback from a range of stakeholders regarding the uses of test results for particular purposes.

As further work, such as that being undertaken in the English Profile project, enriches our understanding of the CEFR levels, further refinements may be possible.

Further information

Q1. Some IELTS band scores are shown as borderline (e.g. it is not clear whether band 5 is B1 or B2). How should institutions and organisations interpret this? As IELTS preceded the CEFR, IELTS band score thresholds have never aligned exactly with the CEFR transition points. Previously (Taylor 2004a), we provided advice as to the score on IELTS that a test taker who was at a given CEFR level might achieve. However, our research shows that
a C1 minimum threshold would fall between the 6.5 and 7 thresholds on the IELTS scale. Therefore, whilst many
6.5 test takers would be at C1, a number will be marginally below. The present table makes this clearer. So if an institution requires a high degree of confidence that an applicant is at C1, they may wish to set a requirement of 7, rather than 6.5.

Q2. Does IELTS differentiate at C2 level? Band scores of 8.5 and higher constitute C2 level performance. Band 8 is borderline.

Q3. If a student has an IELTS score of 6.5 should this be treated as a B2 equivalent score?
6.5 is borderline B2/C1. It is for institutions to decide alignment to a particular level of the CEFR is critical. Otherwise, our general advice remains that an overall IELTS band 7.0 will probably meet the language requirements of most university courses, though 6.5 may be adequate for courses which are less linguistically
demanding. Institutions need to consider a range of factors in setting their requirements, including, for example the amount of pre-sessional or in-sessional language-learning support which will be available to prospective students, and whether a minimum standard should also be specified in a particular individual skill.

Q4. How does this compare to the mappings that other language testers have published? We do not comment on the benchmarking exercises that other language testers have provided.

Teacher resources
A range of resources have been developed to help teachers engage test takers and prepare them for their test.


Online videos

The IELTS YouTube channel features a number of teaching tips videos, including:
� Bingo
� Chain writing
� Speed dating
� Reading race

Classroom exercises
These classroom exercises are a good way to help test takers develop specific skills and prepare for different parts of the test.
Pre-reading
to help test takers prepare for a reading text

� Give test takers the title of a reading text and perhaps a relevant picture or song
� In groups, test takers predict vocabulary, phrases, information and ideas that might be in the text
� Test takers then read the text to check whether their predictions were correct
� Give test takers the opportunity to ask questions about the text or specific expressions or language
Getting to know graphs
to help test takers understand how data can be communicated

� As a whole class, brainstorm how people learn English outside the classroom - keep the list to about eight options
� In pairs, test takers survey staff and students at their institution on how best to learn a language outside of the classroom, making note of the age, sex, and nationality of interviewees. As homework, test takers organise their notes
� In class, test takers get in to bigger groups and share the data they have collected
� Then, in pairs again, test takers choose a type of graph out of a hat, e.g. line graph, bar chart or pie chart
� Test takers make their graph according to the data they have gathered from the survey
� They then write an introductory paragraph summarising their graph and the information it shows
� Once this stage is complete, they give the graph and introduction to another pair who write the body of the text
Topic dice
to familiarise test takers with topics that may come up in Part 2 and to develop fluency

� Test takers work in groups and brainstorm topics that may come up in Part 2 of the speaking test. Teacher checks that all topics are relevant
� From the list, test takers choose six topics - three that they like and three that they don't
� Together, they brainstorm everything that they know about the topics
� The topics are numbered 1- 6 and each group is given a dice
� Test takers take turns to throw the dice and talk about the topic that corresponds with their number
� Test takers should talk for 1-2 minutes. They can use the notes made during the brainstorming session
Bingo
to help test takers practise listening for specific words

� Tell test takers they are going to listen to a text from an IELTS Listening test, e.g. a conversation about leisure activities, an interview for a part-time job, etc.
� As a group, they have to predict words they think will hear in the text. Individually, they choose nine words and write them in a bingo grid
� Play the Listening test. If test takers hear any of the words on their grid, they should cross them out
� When a test taker has crossed out three words in a row, they should shout 'BINGO!'

Helping your test takers prepare









Preparation materials and advice for test takers can be found online at ielts.org/prepare

Test takers are advised to:
� Consider taking an English language course. Although it is not a requirement for test takers to attend a language course, it is proven to be one of the most effective ways to improve language proficiency. A course will not only provide more opportunity for your test takers to practise their English, it will also ensure they receive constructive feedback to help them improve
� Read the Information for Candidates booklet. This contains essential guidance which every test taker should read in relation to test format, task types, time limits and test procedures
� Understanding the IELTS band scale (page 6) and the IELTS assessment criteria (ielts.org/criteria). This will help your test takers determine whether they are ready to sit the test




� Use their English everyday at home and at work/university - this includes speaking English with friends, watching and listening to English language programmes, reading English publications and practising their written skills wherever possible
� Practise with the free test samples available at ielts.org/ sampletest in order to better understand what is expected in each part of the test
� Consider purchasing the IELTS Official Practice Materials books from an IELTS test centre. Many independent IELTS products are also available
� Take an official IELTS practice test online at ieltsprogresscheck.com, which includes a feedback report on areas for improvement
� Think about taking an IELTS preparation course where test takers will receive feedback on their answers to practice questions
